      Holy Moly & The Crackers make riotous party music for the masses. Their
      upcoming third album, ‘Take A Bite’ (released April 5th 2019 on the band’s
      own Pink Lane Records), is concise, passionate take on folk, blues and
      indie rock. The sound of a band who have been searching and experimenting
      for several years; arriving at a place where they can say “this is who we
      are and this is where we want to go”.<br/> <br/> HMATC Webpage - <br/> <a

      Reg Meuross is quite simply an astounding songwriter and musician. With
      songs ranging from heart warming expressions on what it means to be
      English (England green and England grey) through eye-opening insights into
      modern day working Britain (Angel in a blue dress) by way of observances
      on the human condition (Leaving Alabama) to heart rending historical
      tributes which still have meaning (For Sophie). It is this song writing
      skill that has artists such as Seth Lakeman and Pete Townsend wanting to
      work with Reg and all delivered with incredible humanity, humour and
      musicianship. "Reg proves himself one of the key songwriters of our age."

      Ron Truman-Border is a wonder. With consummate professionalism Ron's songs
      will take the listener from the shady side of life back to days when
      little English boys dreamed dreams of America and back again. As tribute
      songs go Ron's tribute to Fleetwood Mac founder Peter Green stands on a
      par with American Pie and Master Blaster Jammin.  Ron's Website - <a

      Will Kaufman a.k.a. Professor of American Literature and Culture at the
      University of Central Lancashire in Preston, a.k.a. that guy who can
      really play, sing and delivers a Woody Guthrie song like it should be.
      a.k.a. You know, the one who wrote all those books, the one who was on
      TEDTalks, the one ... Not only are Will's sets insightful and well
      researched, his delivery is slick entertaining and very humorous (correct
      spelling). Oh, he can play and sing a bit as well - not to be missed.

      Jack Cookson is annoyingly young, irritatingly gifted and his only
      redeeming features being his disarming charm, effortless politeness and
      wonderful musicianship.  He is a talented multi-instrumentalist
      performer/session musician, singer/song writer, producer and after lunch
      ....  Don't take our word for this, his prior appearances with Franz
      Nicolay, Cory Branan and Ralph McTell speaks volumes as does his 2016
      nomination as one of four finalists for BBC Radio2 Young Folk Award.
