artist_1: Holy Molly & The Crackers
artist_1_description: Holy Moly & The Crackers make riotous party music for the masses. Their upcoming third album, ‘Take A Bite’ (released April 5th 2019 on the band’s own Pink Lane Records), is concise, passionate take on folk, blues and indie rock. The sound of a band who have been searching and experimenting for several years; arriving at a place where they can say “this who we are and this is where we want to go”.

artist_2: Reg Meuross
artist_2_description: Reg Meuross is quite simply an astounding songwriter and musician. With songs ranging from heart warming expressions on what it means to be English (England green and England grey) through eye-opening insights into modern day working Britain (Angel in a blue dress) by way of observances on the human condition (Leaving Alabama) to heart rending historical tributes which still have meaning (For Sophie). It is this song writing skill that has artists such as Seth Lakeman and Pete Townsend wanting to work with Reg and all delivered with incredible humanity, humour and musicianship. "Reg proves himself one of the key songwriters of our age." David Kidman, Fatea Magazine. Reg's Website - http://www.regmeuross.com/
