      The Ryan theatre is a modern, well appointed and comfortable theatre which
      although it has seating for over 300+ guests has a very intimate feel. 
      This venue is Folk-On-The-Hill's main stage and all featured artists will
      be performing here along with (time permitting) a stage for introducing
      less experienced acts who deserve and would benefit from playing to a
      large audience.  Food and drink will be available outside the auditorium
      with a pleasant garden area as it's dining area.
